  <div><p> the scope of practice for physical therapists is dynamic, evolving with evidence, education, and social needs.</p></div> <br>
  <div><p> The scope of practice for physical therapists has three components: professional, jurisdictional, and personal.

    The professional scope of practice is grounded in the profession’s unique body of knowledge, supported by educational preparation, based on a body of evidence, and linked to existing or emerging practice frameworks.<br>
    
    The jurisdictional (i.e., legal) scope of practice is established by a state's practice act governing the specific physical therapist’s license, and the rules adopted pursuant to that act. 
    The Model Practice Act for Physical Therapy (MPA) is the preeminent standard and most effective tool at the state level for revising and modernizing physical therapy practice acts via legislation. <br>
    
    Personal scope of practice consists of activities for which an individual physical therapist is educated and trained and their competence to perform.</p></div>
